# Natours-project
Natour is a fictional nature tour booking service project. The main goal of this project was to build a responsive landing page using the CSS Grid layout method.

In addition to CSS Grid, the project also covers the use of SVG icons, BEM methodology, responsive design, and various useful CSS tricks and helpful online tools.
